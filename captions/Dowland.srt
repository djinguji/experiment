1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,280
Sleep wayward thoughts,

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,720
and rest you with my love.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,100
Let not my love, with my love be diseased.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,000
Touch not proud hands,

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,300
lest you her anger move,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,760
But pine you with my longing long displeased.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,160
Thus while she sleeps, I sorrow for her sake,

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,740
So sleeps my love, and yet, my love doth wake.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,240
Thus while she sleeps, I sorrow for her sake,

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:58,240
So sleeps my love, and yet, my love doth wake.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,440
My love doth rage, and yet my love doth rest,

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,380
Fear in my love, and yet my love secure.

13
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,880
Peace in my love, and yet my love oppressed,

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:25,080
Impatient, yet of perfect temperature.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,200
Sleep dainty, love, while I sigh for thy sake,

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,980
So sleeps my love, and yet, my love doth wake.

17
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,980
Sleep dainty, love, while I sigh for thy sake,

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:51,940
So sleeps my love, and yet, my love doth wake.
